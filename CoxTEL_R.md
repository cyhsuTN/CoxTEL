# Code for R users

A demo survival figure for CoxTEL. The KM curves and HR with 95% CI are
estimated from simulated data.

Figure 1: Reported KM curves and HR with 95% CI

### First step: manually extract probabilities from KM curves

Users can use the following R code to extract the probabilities from
Kaplan-Meier curves by mouse-clicks.

``` r
library(imager)
library(IPDfromKM)
```

``` r
imgexp <- imager::load.image("../Demo_Fig.png") #png/jpg (bitmap images)
```

Please decide the limits of x-axis and y-axis when executing the R
command line below. For example, x = c(0,48) and y = c(0, 1) for the
demo figure.
``` r
df <- IPDfromKM::getpoints(imgexp, 0, 48, 0, 1)
```

Will pop out messages on the R console. Please follow the instruction to
extract survival probabilities at specific time points, for example, at
the 6th, 12th, …, 48th months. Once users complete the mouse-clicks,
please click “Esc” on the keyboard.

df saves all survival probabilities at the 6th, 12th, …, 48th months.
Besides, users also need to extract the cure proportions from plateaus
at the tails of survival curves. In this case, the cure proportions are
the survival probabilities at the 48th months.

### Second step: input the extracted probabilities and the reported Cox HR as well as CI

``` r
s1mix.chosen <- c(.34, .23, .19, .14, .13, .12, .11, .11) # extracted prob. in treatment arm
s0mix.chosen <- c(.41, .22, .12, .08, .06, .04, .03, .03) # extracted prob. in control arm
pi1.est <- 1 - 0.11 # uncured proportion in treatment arm
pi0.est <- 1 - 0.03 # uncured proportion in control arm
HR_cox <- 0.92 # reported Cox HR
HR_cox_CI <- c(0.77, 1.10) # reported Cox HR CI

adjustment(HR_cox, HR_cox_CI, s1mix.chosen, s0mix.chosen, pi1.est, pi0.est)
```

CoxTEL HR: 1.185 (0.992 to 1.417) for short-term survivors; CoxTEL DP:
0.080 (0.038 to 0.123) for long-term survivors.

Proportion.LTS: the estimates for the proportions of long-term survivors in both arms.
